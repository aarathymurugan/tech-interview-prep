If you want to learn how our technical admissions interviews work or you'd like
tips on how to prepare, you're in the right place!

## How do these interviews work?

Our interviews are about **30 min. long**, so you should set aside 30 min. of
time where you're free, have access to the internet, and able to talk with
someone on the phone.

During the interview, you'll get a phone call from one of our friendly
interviewers. You'll work with the interviewer to solve a code challenge.
**You'll be able to use your language of choice** to solve the code challenge.

Your interviewer will save some time at the end of the 30 min. where you can
ask questions about the program ü§ó

Checklist

- [ ] Have worked with strings, numbers (integers), and arrays/lists before
- [ ] Can think of an example of when you'd use a while-loop and when you'd use
  a for-loop
- [ ] Write a function with parameters that returns a value
- [ ] Add up all the numbers in an array/list of numbers by hand (without using
  built-in functions or methods)
- [ ] Use conditional logic and loops to filter an array/list (ex.: "given a
  list of words, return all words that start with `'b'`")
